# Networking
Adhoc scripts:

webget - an implementation of the Linux utility "wget"

email_program - a simple implementation of an command line utility email client using SMTP

portscan - a lightweight port scanner that checks for open ports between the range 0-1023 (well-known system ports)

word_finder - a dictionary/thesaurus tool for faster word lookups (than doing a google search)
